# Borogu Fix Verification - December 24, 2025

## Issue
Borogu needed to be listed in BOTH "Heady Sorten" AND "Balanced Sorten" categories 
with "Heavy / Balanced" badge, as it has characteristics of both categories.

## Fix Applied
1. Added Borogu to headySorten array with badge: "Heavy / Balanced"
2. Updated Borogu in balancedSorten array with badge: "Heavy / Balanced"  
3. Modified rendering logic to display custom badge if provided

## Verification (Screenshots taken)
- Heady Sorten section: Borogu appears with "Heavy / Balanced" badge ✓
- Balanced Sorten section: Borogu appears with "Heavy / Balanced" badge ✓
- Sortenvergleich table: Borogu shows "Heavy / Balanced" type ✓

## Consistency Check
This is now consistent with the Vanuatu-Sorten page where Borogu is described as:
"Vielseitig einsetzbar: kopfbetonte Anfangswirkung, dann körperliche Entspannung"
(Versatile: head-focused initial effect, then physical relaxation)

Fix complete and verified.
