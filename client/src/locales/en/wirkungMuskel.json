    "paragraph1": "The <strong>muscle-relaxing effect</strong> of Kava is one of the most noticeable effects. After the first shell, a wave of relaxation begins to move through the body – tensions dissolve, and the body feels \"heavy\" and pleasant.",

This reduces the excitability of motor neurons (nerve cells that control muscles) and leads to a decrease in muscle tone. This mechanism is also responsible for the <strong>anticonvulsive</strong> (spasm-relieving) effect."
