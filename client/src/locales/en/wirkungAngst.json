    "paragraph1": "The <strong>anxiolytic effect</strong> (anxiolysis) is the best-documented and scientifically studied property of Kava. For millennia, the peoples of the Pacific have used the plant to find inner peace – and modern research confirms this traditional use.",
    "paragraph2": "In contrast to pharmaceutical anxiolytics like benzodiazepines, Kava works <strong>without cognitive impairments</strong>. The mind remains clear and focused while tension and worries dissolve. This unique state is often described as \"alert relaxation\" or \"active calmness.\""

  "wirkmechanismus": {
    "title": "Mechanism of Action",
    "intro": "The anxiolytic effect of Kava is based on a complex interplay of several neurobiological mechanisms. At the center is the modulation of the <strong>GABA system</strong>, but other neurotransmitter systems are also involved.",
    "gaba": {
      "title": "The GABA System",
      "intro": "GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric acid) is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. When GABA binds to its receptor, a chloride channel opens, negative ions flow into the nerve cell, and it becomes less excitable. The result: <strong>Calmness, relaxation, anxiety relief</strong>.",
      "boxTitle": "The Process of GABA Modulation",
      "steps": [
        "Kavalactone (e.g., Kavain) reaches the brain via the bloodstream",
        "Binding to the GABA-A receptor on nerve cells (at a different site than benzodiazepines)",
        "Opening of the chloride channel → increased influx of Cl⁻ ions",
        "Neuronal hyperpolarization → the excitability of the neuron decreases",
        "Noticeable effect: Calmness, anxiety relief, muscular relaxation"
      ],
      "conclusion": "The crucial difference from benzodiazepines: Kavalactones bind at a <strong>different site on the GABA-A receptor</strong>. This explains why Kava does not cause dependence and does not impair cognitive functions."

          "title": "MAO-B Inhibition",
          "text": "Some Kavalactones (especially Desmethoxyyangonin) inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase-B. This slows down the breakdown of dopamine and contributes to the <strong>mood-enhancing</strong> effect – without the risks of classical MAO inhibitors."
