  "intro": {
    "paragraph1": "The <strong>anxiolytic effect</strong> (anxiolysis) is the best-documented and scientifically studied property of Kava. For thousands of years, the peoples of the Pacific have used the plant to find inner peace – and modern research confirms this traditional use.",
    "paragraph2": "In contrast to pharmaceutical anxiolytics like benzodiazepines, Kava works <strong>without cognitive impairments</strong>. The mind remains clear and focused while tension and worries dissolve. This unique state is often described as \"alert relaxation\" or \"active calmness.\""
  },
  "wirkmechanismus": {
    "title": "Mechanism of Action",
    "intro": "The anxiolytic effect of Kava is based on a complex interplay of several neurobiological mechanisms. At its core is the modulation of the <strong>GABA system</strong>, but other neurotransmitter systems are also involved."
  },
  "gabaSystem": {
    "title": "The GABA System",
    "intro": "GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid) is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. When GABA binds to its receptor, a chloride channel opens, negative ions flow into the nerve cell, and it becomes less excitable. The result: <strong>Calmness, relaxation, anxiety relief</strong>.",
    "modulationTitle": "The Process of GABA Modulation",
    "steps": [
      "Kavalactone (e.g., Kavain) reaches the brain via the bloodstream",
      "Binding to the GABA-A receptor on nerve cells (at a different site than benzodiazepines)",
      "Opening of the chloride channel → increased influx of Cl⁻ ions",
      "Neuronal hyperpolarization → the excitability of the neuron decreases",
      "Noticeable effect: Calmness, anxiety relief, muscular relaxation"
    ],
    "difference": "The crucial difference from benzodiazepines: Kavalactones bind at a <strong>different site of the GABA-A receptor</strong>. This explains why Kava does not cause dependency and does not impair cognitive functions."

    "title": "Additional Mechanisms",
    "natriumCalcium": {
      "title": "Sodium/Calcium Channel Blockade",
      "description": "Kavalactones block voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels. This reduces the excitability of nerve cells and contributes to the calming effect. This mechanism is also responsible for the <strong>anticonvulsant</strong> effect."
    },
    "maoB": {
      "title": "MAO-B Inhibition",
      "description": "Some Kavalactones (especially Desmethoxyyangonin) inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase-B. This slows the breakdown of dopamine and contributes to the <strong>mood-enhancing</strong> effect – without the risks of classical MAO inhibitors."
    },
    "noradrenalin": {
      "title": "Norepinephrine Reuptake",
      "description": "Inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake contributes to <strong>enhanced concentration</strong> without causing nervousness. This explains the \"alert relaxation\" that distinguishes Kava from sedative substances."

      "title": "CB1 Receptor Affinity",
