    "paragraph1": "Kava is often referred to as \"nature's benzodiazepine\", but this comparison is misleading. While it has strong anxiolytic and relaxing effects, it keeps the mind clear and focused, unlike alcohol or pharmaceutical sedatives.",
    "paragraph2": "The state is often described as \"active relaxation\": one feels calm and content but is fully capable of action and socially open."
