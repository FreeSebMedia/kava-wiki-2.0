      "lead": "The distinction between <strong>Noble Kava</strong> and <strong>Tudei Kava</strong> is the most fundamental classification in the world of Kava. It determines whether a Kava experience is pleasant and safe or unpleasant and potentially harmful.",
      "text": "The term \"Tudei\" (also spelled \"Two-Day\") comes from Bislama, the creole language of Vanuatu, and literally means \"two days\" – a reference to the extremely long duration of effects of these varieties. Noble Kava, on the other hand, has been selected over centuries by Pacific cultures for daily use and offers a pleasant, controllable effect."

      "title": "History of Classification",
      "p1": "The formal distinction between Noble and Tudei Kava was introduced by the <strong>Government of Vanuatu</strong> to regulate the quality of export Kava. In 2002, Vanuatu enacted the <strong>Kava Act</strong>, which prohibits the export of Tudei varieties. This legislation was a response to reports of liver damage in Europe associated with low-quality Kava products.",
      "p2": "The research of <strong>Dr. Vincent Lebot</strong>, a leading Kava scientist, was crucial for the development of this classification. Lebot developed methods for the chemical analysis of Kava varieties and identified the <a href=\"/de/inhaltsstoffe/chemotypen\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">chemotypes</a> that distinguish Noble from Tudei.",
      "quote": "The classification into Noble and Tudei is based not on subjective preferences, but on measurable chemical differences that directly correlate with safety and tolerability.",
