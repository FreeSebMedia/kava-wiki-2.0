    "paragraph1": "Kava has been known for its <strong>sleep-promoting effects</strong> for thousands of years. In the Pacific Islands, it is traditionally consumed in the evening to wind down the day and promote restful sleep. Modern research confirms: Kava not only improves falling asleep but also <strong>sleep quality</strong>.",
    "paragraph2": "The special thing: Unlike pharmaceutical sleep aids, Kava does not cause a \"hangover\" the next morning. Many users even report a particularly <strong>fresh, clear awakening</strong> – the so-called \"Kava Afterglow.\""

      "title": "Kava vs. Alcohol in Sleep",
      "text": "While alcohol can speed up falling asleep, it <strong>significantly worsens</strong> sleep quality: it suppresses REM sleep, leads to fragmented sleep, and causes dehydration.
