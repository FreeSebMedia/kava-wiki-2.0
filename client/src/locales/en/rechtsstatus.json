        "question": "Can I order Kava from the USA?",

In this case, the shipment is usually returned to the sender or destroyed. It is advisable to order from European vendors who have already imported the goods into the EU.</p>"

        "question": "Is possession of Kava illegal?",

        "question": "Why is Kava not available in pharmacies?",
        "answer": "<p class=\"mb-2\">After the ban of 2002 (which was lifted in 2014/2015), many pharmaceutical manufacturers did not renew their approvals as the process is costly and cumbersome.</p><p>Currently, there are hardly any approved Kava finished medicinal products in Germany. Kava is therefore primarily available as a raw material (e.g., as a \"bath additive\" or ethnobotanical demonstration material) or in some cases as a dietary supplement (in other EU countries).</p>"

        "question": "Can I take Kava on the plane?",
        "answer": "<p class=\"mb-2\">Within the EU, this is generally unproblematic as long as it is for personal use.</p><p>When traveling outside the EU (e.g., to Australia, New Zealand, or the USA), you should check the import regulations there. In some countries (e.g., Singapore, Japan), stricter rules may apply. Check with the respective embassy before traveling.</p>"

      {
        "question": "Is Kava a \"Novel Food\"?",
        "answer": "<p class=\"mb-2\"><strong>According to prevailing legal opinion: No.</strong></p><p>A \"Novel Food\" is a food that was not consumed in significant quantities in the EU before May 15, 1997. However, since Kava was already present in Europe long before this cut-off date (also as food/pleasure product in health food stores) and as a medicinal product, the Novel Food Regulation does not apply here. Nevertheless, some authorities occasionally attempt to classify Kava as such, which is legally contestable.</p>"
