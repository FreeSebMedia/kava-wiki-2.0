    "paragraph1": "One of the most remarkable properties of Kava is that it <strong>relaxes without sedating</strong>. Unlike alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other sedatives, the mind remains clear and focused. Many users even report <strong>improved concentration</strong> and more creative thinking.",
