    "paragraph1": "Kava has been known for its <strong>sleep-promoting effects</strong> for thousands of years. In the Pacific Islands, it is traditionally consumed in the evening to wind down the day and promote restful sleep. Modern research confirms: Kava not only improves falling asleep but also the <strong>quality of sleep</strong>.",
    "paragraph2": "The special thing: Unlike pharmaceutical sleep aids, Kava does not cause a \"hangover\" the next morning. Many users even report a particularly <strong>fresh, clear awakening</strong> – the so-called \"Kava Afterglow.\""

      "title": "Deep Sleep (Slow-Wave Sleep)",
      "description": "Kava promotes <strong>deep sleep</strong>, the most restorative sleep phase. During this phase, growth hormones are released, the immune system is strengthened, and memories are consolidated. Users report a \"deeper\" feeling of sleep."

    "rem": {
      "title": "REM Sleep",
      "description": "Unlike alcohol or benzodiazepines, Kava does not suppress <strong>REM sleep</strong>. This phase is important for emotional processing and creativity. Many Kava users report vivid, pleasant dreams."

    "vergleich": {
      "title": "Kava vs. Alcohol in Sleep",
      "description": "While alcohol can speed up falling asleep, it <strong>significantly worsens</strong> sleep quality: It suppresses REM sleep, leads to fragmented sleep, and causes dehydration. Kava, on the other hand, promotes a <strong>natural, restful sleep cycle</strong> without these negative effects."

      "title": "GABA Enhancement",
      "description": "The modulation of GABA-A receptors is the main mechanism. GABA is the most important \"brake\" neurotransmitter in the brain. By enhancing its effect, the nervous system is calmed, and the transition into sleep is facilitated."
