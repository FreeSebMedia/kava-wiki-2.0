    "paragraph1": "<strong>Piper methysticum</strong>, commonly known as Kava or Kava-Kava, is a tropical shrub from the pepper family (Piperaceae). The name <em>Piper methysticum</em> translates to \"intoxicating pepper\" (from the Greek <em>methystikos</em> = intoxicating).",
    "paragraph2": "Unlike many other psychoactive plants, Kava does not contain alkaloids as its main active compounds, but rather a unique class of substances known as <strong>Kavalactones</strong>. The plant has played a central role in Pacific Island cultures for thousands of years and is the result of millennia of human selection."
