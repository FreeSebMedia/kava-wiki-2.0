      "shortDefinition": "The psychoactive compounds in Kava",
      "fullExplanation": "Kavalactones are a group of 18 lactones responsible for the psychoactive effects of Kava. The **six main Kavalactones** make up about 96% of the total content: Desmethoxyyangonin (DMY), Dihydrokavain (DHK), Yangonin (Y), Kavain (K), Dihydromethysticin (DHM), and Methysticin (M). Each Kavalactone has its own effect profile – from anxiolytic to muscle relaxant to sedative. The total content in the root typically ranges from 3-20%.",

      "fullExplanation": "The chemotype is a **6-digit code** that indicates the order of the six main Kavalactones by concentration. Each Kavalactone has a number: 1=DMY, 2=DHK, 3=Y, 4=K, 5=DHM, 6=M. A chemotype like \"426315\" means: Kavain (4) is the highest concentrated, followed by DHK (2), etc. The chemotype significantly determines the effect of a variety – whether it is more \"heady\" (cerebral, euphoric) or \"heavy\" (physical, sedative).",

In high concentrations (5 in the first position), it is typical for Tudei Kava and can lead to prolonged side effects. In Noble Kava, DHM is present in moderate amounts and contributes to the relaxing effect. DHM has a longer half-life than Kavain, which is why Tudei effects can last up to two days.",

This wild species occurs in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands and can reproduce sexually (unlike the sterile cultivated form). Scientists believe that Kava was **domesticated** from Piper wichmannii about 3,000 years ago.

While Flavokavain A and C are considered relatively safe, **Flavokavain B (FKB)** is associated with potential liver toxicity.

It reduces neuronal excitability and has calming, anxiolytic, and sleep-promoting effects. Kavalactones – particularly Kavain and DHK – modulate GABA receptors, but in a **different way than benzodiazepines**. This explains why Kava relaxes without the typical side effects of sleeping pills (no dependence, no cognitive impairment).",

      "fullExplanation": "Reverse Tolerance is a **unique phenomenon with Kava**: Unlike most psychoactive substances, where one needs more over time for the same effect, with Kava it is **the opposite**. Many newcomers feel little or nothing the first time. After several sessions (typically 3-7 days of regular use), the body \"opens up\" to Kavalactones, and the effect becomes significantly stronger. The exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood but may relate to the accumulation of Kavalactones in fat tissue or receptor sensitization.",

This euphoria differs from that caused by alcohol or other substances: it is **clear, social, and not disinhibiting**.
