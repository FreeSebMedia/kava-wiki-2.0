        "description": "While <em>P. wichmannii</em> is diploid (2n = 26), <em>P. methysticum</em> is decaploid (2n = 130). This multiplication of the chromosome set led to larger roots and higher kavalactone content."

    "title": "Kava as Living Cultural Heritage",
    "paragraph1": "Since Kava cannot reproduce on its own, every plant existing today is the result of an unbroken chain of human transmission. Cuttings have been passed from generation to generation, from family to family, from village to village.",

      "text": "Kava is thus one of the oldest documented examples of consciously selective agriculture in the South Pacific. The plant is a living cultural heritage – passed down from generation to generation.",

    },
    "paragraph2": "In the countries of origin, Kava is not just seen as a crop plant, but often as a <strong>living being</strong> – with name, character, and history. It is not uncommon for individual plants to be named and revered in rituals. This deep connection between humans and plant is what makes Kava not only effective but also meaningful.",
    "paragraph3": "The dependence on humans also has a dark side: Without continuous cultivation, <em>Piper methysticum</em> would become extinct within a generation. This underscores the responsibility that comes with growing and trading Kava."
