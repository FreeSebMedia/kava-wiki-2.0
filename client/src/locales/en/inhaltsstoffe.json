    "paragraph1": "The psychoactive effect of Kava is primarily produced by a group of compounds known as <strong>Kavalactones</strong> (or Kava Pyrones). Unlike many other psychoactive plants (such as coffee or tea), Kava does not contain alkaloids as its main active ingredients.",
    "paragraph2": "So far, 18 different Kavalactones have been identified, of which six are responsible for over 96% of the pharmacological effect. These six 'Major Kavalactones' form the basis for the classification and quality determination of Kava."

    "exampleTitle": "Example: Chemotype 426531",

    "tudeiDescription": "<strong>Tudei Kava:</strong> Chemotypes often start with <strong>5</strong> (Dihydromethysticin) or <strong>2</strong> with a very high proportion of 5. DHM is broken down very slowly and can lead to days of fatigue and nausea.",

  "synergien": {
    "title": "Synergies & Entourage Effect",
    "paragraph1": "Similar to cannabis (terpenes & cannabinoids), the total extract of Kava is more effective than isolated Kavalactones. This is referred to as the entourage effect.",
    "paragraph2": "Isolated Kavain is anxiolytic, but the combination with Yangonin (MAO-B inhibition) and Desmethoxyyangonin (dopamine increase) significantly enhances the mood-lifting effect. Therefore, traditional preparations or full-spectrum extracts are preferred over isolated active ingredients."
