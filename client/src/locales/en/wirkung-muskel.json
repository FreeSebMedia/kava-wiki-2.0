    "paragraph1": "The <strong>muscle-relaxing effect</strong> of Kava is one of the most noticeable effects. Already after the first shell, a wave of relaxation begins to move through the body – tensions dissolve, and the body feels \"heavy\" and pleasant.",
    "paragraph2": "In traditional use in the Pacific, Kava has been used for thousands of years to relieve muscle pain and physical tension. Modern research has clarified the underlying mechanisms."

  "mechanismen": {
    "title": "Mechanisms of Action",
    "intro": "The muscle-relaxing effect of Kava is based on several synergistic mechanisms that act both centrally (brain/spinal cord) and peripherally.",
    "natrium": {
      "title": "Sodium and Calcium Channel Blockade",
      "description": "Kavalactones block voltage-dependent <strong>sodium and calcium channels</strong> in nerve cells. This reduces the excitability of motor neurons (nerve cells that control muscles) and leads to a decrease in muscle tone. This mechanism is also responsible for the <strong>anticonvulsive</strong> (spasm-relieving) effect."
    },
    "gaba": {
      "title": "Central GABA Modulation",
      "description": "The enhancement of GABA action in the brain and spinal cord reduces <strong>central muscle tension</strong>. GABA is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter and also regulates muscle tone at the spinal level."
    },
    "peripher": {
      "title": "Peripheral Effect",
      "description": "Some Kavalactones also act directly on the <strong>smooth muscle</strong> (e.g., in blood vessels). This can lead to slight vasodilation (blood vessel widening) and explains the warm feeling that many users report."

      "description": "DHK is the <strong>strongest muscle-relaxing</strong> Kavalactone. It primarily acts through the blockade of sodium channels and has a pronounced sedative component.",
      "profile": "Strongly muscle-relaxing, sedating, body-focused. Ideal for evening use and for tension relief."

    "dhm": {
      "title": "Dihydromethysticin (DHM)",
      "position": "Position 5 in the chemotype",
      "description": "DHM also has strong muscle-relaxing properties, but it is also the Kavalactone with the <strong>longest duration of action</strong>. At high concentrations, it can lead to prolonged fatigue.",
      "warning": "High DHM concentrations (Position 1-2) are typical for Tudei varieties and can lead to \"hangover\" symptoms."
