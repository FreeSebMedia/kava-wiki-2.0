      "lead": "<strong>Vanuatu</strong> is believed to be the original home of Kava and hosts the largest variety in the world with over 80 documented varieties. Many of these varieties are unique to specific islands of the archipelago and have been cultivated by local communities for centuries.",
      "text": "The diversity of Vanuatu is explained by the isolated location of the individual islands and the long tradition of vegetative propagation. Since Kava does not produce seeds, each island developed its own cultivars, adapted to local soils, climate, and cultural preferences. Today, Vanuatu exports the majority of Kava consumed worldwide and has established strict quality standards that prohibit the export of Tudei varieties.",
      "localNames": "<strong>Local Names:</strong> In Vanuatu, Kava is referred to differently depending on the island and language: <em>Kava</em>, <em>Malok</em>, <em>Malogu</em>, or <em>Nakamal</em> (the latter also refers to traditional Kava bars)."

      "description2": "The chemotype 243516 shows a balanced mix with DHK in the first position, which is responsible for the body-focused, relaxing effect. Kavain in the second position provides mental clarity.",

        "<strong>Mental Calm:</strong> Calms the mind without clouding it",

      "effects": [
        "<strong>Balanced:</strong> Perfect balance between head and body effects",

      "note": "Kelai is often more expensive and harder to find than other varieties. The island of Epi produces only limited quantities, which can lead to shortages."
