    "paragraph1": "One of the most remarkable properties of Kava is that it <strong>relaxes without sedating</strong>. Unlike alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other sedatives, the mind remains clear and focused. Many users even report <strong>improved concentration</strong> and more creative thinking.",
    "paragraph2": "In addition, there is a unique phenomenon: <strong>Reverse Tolerance</strong>. While the effects of most psychoactive substances diminish over time, they can actually increase with Kava."

    "title": "Mental Clarity",
    "intro": "The \"alert relaxation\" provided by Kava is one of its distinguishing features. This state is often described as <strong>\"active calmness\"</strong>: one is calm and relaxed but fully present and capable of action.",
