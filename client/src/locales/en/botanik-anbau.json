    "paragraph1": "The cultivation of kava is an art that has been passed down from generation to generation for thousands of years. Since <em>Piper methysticum</em> is sterile and produces no seeds, the plant is completely dependent on humans. This unique dependency has led to a deep cultural connection between Pacific peoples and their sacred plant."
