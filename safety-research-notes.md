# Kava Safety Research Notes

## Key Sources Analyzed

### 1. EMA Assessment Report (2017)
- 103-page comprehensive assessment
- Clinical trials showed no significant hepatotoxicity
- Adverse effects in trials: slight transaminase increases in some subjects
- Risk factors identified: organic extracts, alcohol, pre-existing liver disease, genetic polymorphisms

### 2. WHO Hepatotoxicity Assessment (2007)
- 93 case reports identified worldwide
- 7 deaths, 14 liver transplants
- Only 8 cases rated as "probable" association
- 53 cases rated as "possible"
- Most cases incomplete data
- Acetonic/ethanolic extracts showed higher risk than synthetic products
- Key finding: Non-kavalactone constituents may be responsible for hepatotoxicity

### 3. FAO/WHO Safety Review (2016)
- Traditional beverage consumption considered safe
- No evidence of hepatotoxicity with traditional water-based preparations
- Clinical trials show no liver damage
- Heavy use causes reversible effects: skin rash, weight loss, GGT elevation
- Risk factors: organic extracts, heavy alcohol, pre-existing liver disease, CYP450 polymorphisms

### 4. NTP Toxicity Review (Fu et al., 2008)
- 18 kavalactones identified
- Metabolism via CYP450 enzymes
- Quinone metabolites may contribute to toxicity
- Flavokavins show cytotoxicity in vitro
- Pipermethystine (from aerial parts) highly toxic

## Key Safety Points

### Liver Safety (Hepatotoxizität)
1. **2002 Ban Context**
   - Based on ~70 case reports in Europe
   - Most cases involved acetonic/ethanolic extracts
   - Many confounding factors (alcohol, medications, quality issues)
   - German courts later ruled ban "disproportionate"

2. **Risk Factors for Hepatotoxicity**
   - Organic solvent extracts (acetone, ethanol) vs. water extracts
   - Use of aerial plant parts (contain pipermethystine)
   - Pre-existing liver disease
   - Heavy alcohol consumption
   - CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms
   - Co-medication with hepatotoxic drugs
   - Poor quality/contaminated material

3. **Traditional Use Safety**
   - No documented hepatotoxicity with traditional water preparations
   - Aboriginal Australian studies: no liver damage despite heavy use
   - Pacific Island populations: centuries of use without liver issues

### Drug Interactions (Wechselwirkungen)
1. **CYP450 Inhibition**
   - Kavalactones inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4
   - Can slow metabolism of many medications
   - Particularly relevant for narrow therapeutic index drugs

2. **High-Risk Combinations**
   - Alcohol: synergistic CNS depression, increased liver risk
   - Benzodiazepines: excessive sedation, respiratory depression
   - Antipsychotics: increased sedation, potential interactions
   - Anticoagulants: altered metabolism
   - Levodopa (Parkinson's): may reduce efficacy
   - MAO inhibitors: theoretical serotonin syndrome risk

3. **Moderate Concern**
   - Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs)
   - Anticonvulsants
   - Hepatotoxic medications (statins, acetaminophen)

### Contraindications (Kontraindikationen)
1. **Absolute**
   - Active liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis)
   - Pregnancy and breastfeeding (no safety data)
   - Children under 18

2. **Relative**
   - Planned surgery (2 weeks before - anesthesia interaction)
   - Parkinson's disease (dopamine interaction)
   - Depression (may worsen in some)
   - Driving/operating machinery (sedation)

### Side Effects (Nebenwirkungen)
1. **Common (dose-dependent)**
   - Drowsiness/fatigue
   - Mild nausea
   - Headache
   - Dizziness

2. **With Heavy/Chronic Use**
   - Kava dermopathy (ichthyosiform skin)
   - Weight loss
   - GGT elevation (reversible)
   - Reduced libido
   - Dry/red eyes

3. **Rare**
   - Allergic reactions
   - Dystonic reactions (very rare)
